        PIRs are basically made of a pyroelectric sensor (which you can see
below as the round metal can with a rectangular crystal in the center),
which can detect levels of infrared radiation. Everything emits some low
 level radiation, and the hotter something is, the more radiation is
emitted. The sensor in a motion detector is actually split in two halves.
The reason for that is that we are looking to detect motion (change) not
average IR levels. The two halves are wired up so that they cancel each
other out. If one half sees more or less IR radiation than the other, the
output will swing high or low.
