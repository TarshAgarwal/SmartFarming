        A temperature sensor is an electronic device that measures the
temperature of its environment and converts the input data into
electronic data to record, monitor, or signal temperature changes.
There are many different types of temperature sensors. Some
temperature sensors require direct contact with the physical object
that is being monitored (contact temperature sensors), while others
indirectly measure the temperature of an object (non-contact
temperature sensors).
