        Soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content in soil.
        Since the direct gravimetric measurement of free soil moisture
        requires removing, drying, and weighing of a sample, soil moisture
        sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using
        some other property of the soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric
        constant, or interaction with neutrons, as a proxy for the moisture
        content.The relation between the measured property and soil moisture
        must be calibrated and may vary depending on environmental factors
         such as soil type, temperature, or electric conductivity.
